    "- [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) a JavaScript visualization library with a Python frontend that creates highly interactive visualizations capable of handling very large and/or streaming datasets. The Python front-end outputs a JSON data structure that can be interpreted by the Bokeh JS engine.\n",
    "- [Plotly](http://plot.ly) is an open source product similar to Bokeh.\n",
    "- [Vispy](http://vispy.org/) is focused on dynamic visualizations of very large datasets. Because it is built to target OpenGL and make use of efficient graphics processors in your computer, it is able to render some quite large and stunning visualizations.\n",
    "- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite) are declarative graphics representations, and are the product of years of research into the fundamental language of data visualization. The reference rendering implementation is JavaScript, but the API is language agnostic."
